A 3-partite community detection algorithm


The algorithm was implemented for 3-partite networks and was written in Java. The implementation includes two separate classes, Clust and Graph. The second one includes all the functions that are required to run the algorithm and calculate all the necessary quantities. In  Clust is very simple and includes only the necessary setup, such as the input files and the creation of the graph through the appropriate functions.

The only change that is necessary to run the program is to specify the input file, which has to be set of hyperedges, that is a set of triples. The input file is defined by the variable fileDestination in the Class Clust.
